          An old Vietnamese man shows up at your door. &nbsp;&nbsp;
          <Typist.Delay ms={500} />
          You let him in.

          &quot;My name is Ti·ªÅn. I&apos;m your long-lost uncle. I was in charge
          of safeguarding our family treasure. It is worth millions of
          dollars!&quot;
          <Typist.Delay ms={1000} />
          <br />
          <br />
          &quot;My time has passed. I am entrusting the treasure to one of my
          nephews or nieces. The first person to find it gets to keep
          it!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <Typist.Delay ms={1000} />
          <br />
          &quot;However, only the one who is familiar with our family history
          and culture will deserve to keep our Family Treasure!&quot;
          <br />
          &quot;Will it be you?&quot;
          <Typist.Delay ms={1000} />
          <br />
          <br />
          &quot;Oh, and if you talk to anyone about food
          <Icon as={GiCook} h={6} w={6} />, pay attention. I think I will want
          something good to eat later.&quot;
          <br />
          <br />
          &quot;Good luck!&quot;
