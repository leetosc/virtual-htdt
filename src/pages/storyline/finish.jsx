          You have reached the end of the journey. Although it would be very
          clich√© to say something like &quot;Maybe the real treasure was the
          friends we made along the way&quot;, it is true in this case.
          <br />I hope that through this journey you had a chance to enjoy the
          company of your teammates and get to know each other better, as well
          as gain an appreciation for our homeland. I hope each of you has a
          chance to visit Vietnam someday (if you haven&apos;t already).
          <br />
          <br />
          We will now find out which team is the most deserving of the family
          treasure. Open the Twitch stream and stand by for the Kahoot code. I
          hope you took good notes!
          <br />
          <br />
          In the envelope marked &quot;Do not open until HTDT&quot; there is a
          small envelope. You can open it now, it is a small treasure for you! I
          hope you enjoyed the journey!
          <br />
