              Tet Trung Thu is also known as the ‘Children’s Festival’. This is
              because parents often found themselves away from their children,
              busy tending to their harvest. However, this festival was a way
              for them to relax and spend time with their kids. On this day, you
              will see the streets lit up with lanterns and filled with children
              running around with laughter - some even wearing costumes. It is a
              joyous time for friends and family to enjoy.
