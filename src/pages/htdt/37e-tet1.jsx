              Tết Nguyên Đán, which we often just shorten to Tết, is the biggest
              holiday in Vietnam. Its name translates to ‘Feast of the First
              Morning,’ as it marks the first day of the year, as well as the
              arrival of spring, according to the Lunar calendar. During this
              time, you will see the town filled with the colors red and yellow,
              which the Vietnamese people believe will bring good fortune.
