              &quot;That was fun. I hope you were able to learn a lot about
              them. The next group of people I want you to meet are the Dao
              people. You have to know that the Dao peopleâ€™s religion is a mix
              of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, and they have a lot of
              wisdom to bestow upon us, particularly of their ancestry.&quot;
